# Simuduck

This is an example from [O'Reilly's Head First Design Patterns](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/9780596007126.do) book that illustrates
the **Strategy Pattern**. I rewrote the example in PHP and added unit tests.

## Installation

Get composer

        curl -sS https://getcomposer.org/installer | php

Install dependencies

        php composer.phar install

## Run Tests

In the root directory of the project run:

        php vendor/bin/phpunit
